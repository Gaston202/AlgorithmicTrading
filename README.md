# Algorithmic Trading Repository

Welcome to the Algorithmic Trading Repository! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for developing, backtesting, and analyzing algorithmic trading strategies. It includes tools for loading and processing financial data, implementing trading strategies, and visualizing results. The repository is organized into folders for Strategies, IndicatorPlots, and Data, making it easy to navigate and extend.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```bash
AlgorithmicTrading/
â”œâ”€â”€ Strategies/ # Contains trading strategy implementations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgorithmicTrading.git
    cd AlgorithmicTrading
    ```
2. Add your financial data to the `Data/` folder or use the provided example dataset.

## Example Strategy: BacktestIchimoku

The `BacktestIchimoku` class is an example implementation of a trading strategy based on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. It includes methods for loading data, calculating indicators, generating trading signals, running backtests, and analyzing results.

### Key Features

- **Data Loading**: Load historical price data from CSV files.
- **Indicator Calculation**: Compute technical indicators such as moving averages, Ichimoku Cloud components, RSI, MACD, and ADX.
- **Signal Generation**: Generate buy/sell signals based on predefined rules.
- **Backtesting**: Simulate trading based on generated signals and calculate performance metrics.
- **Analysis**: Analyze backtest results, including win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and more.
- **Visualization**: Plot equity curves, asset performance, and drawdowns.

### Usage

1. Load your data:

    ```python
    bt = BacktestIchimoku()
    bt.load_data('../Data/BTC-USDTH4.csv')
    ```

2. Populate indicators:

    ```python
    bt.populate_indicators()
    ```

3. Generate trading signals:

    ```python
    bt.populate_signals()
    ```

4. Run the backtest:

    ```python
    bt.run_backtest()
    ```

5. Analyze the results:

    ```python
    bt.backtest_analysis()
    ```

6. Visualize the results:

    ```python
    bt.plot_equity_vs_asset()
    ```

## Adding New Strategies

To add a new strategy:

1. Create a new Python file in the `Strategies/` folder.
2. Define a class that implements the following methods:
   - `load_data(path)`: Load data from a file.
   - `populate_indicators()`: Calculate technical indicators.
   - `populate_signals()`: Generate buy/sell signals.
   - `run_backtest()`: Simulate trading based on signals.
   - `backtest_analysis()`: Analyze backtest results.
   - `plot_results()`: Visualize results (optional).
3. Add your strategy to the repository and update the `README.md` with a brief description.

## Data Format

The repository expects historical price data in CSV format with the following columns:

- `date`: Timestamp in milliseconds.
- `open`: Opening price.
- `high`: Highest price during the time period.
- `low`: Lowest price during the time period.
- `close`: Closing price.
- `volume`: Trading volume (optional).

Example:
date,open,high,low,close,volume
1633046400000,47000,47500,46500,47200,1000
1633132800000,47200,48000,47000,47800,1200
...



## Dependencies

The repository relies on the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: Numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: Data visualization.
- `ta`: Technical analysis library for calculating indicators.

Install them using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib ta
```
