Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before using this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

Required Python libraries (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgorithmicTrading.git
cd AlgorithmicTrading
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add your financial data to the Data/ folder or use the provided example dataset.

Example Strategy: BacktestIchimoku
The BacktestIchimoku class is an example implementation of a trading strategy based on the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. It includes methods for loading data, calculating indicators, generating trading signals, running backtests, and analyzing results.

Key Features
Data Loading: Load historical price data from CSV files.

Indicator Calculation: Compute technical indicators such as moving averages, Ichimoku Cloud components, RSI, MACD, and ADX.

Signal Generation: Generate buy/sell signals based on predefined rules.

Backtesting: Simulate trading based on generated signals and calculate performance metrics.

Analysis: Analyze backtest results, including win rate, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and more.

Visualization: Plot equity curves, asset performance, and drawdowns.

Usage
Load your data:

python
Copy
bt = BacktestIchimoku()
bt.load_data('../Data/BTC-USDTH4.csv')
Populate indicators:

python
Copy
bt.populate_indicators()
Generate trading signals:

python
Copy
bt.populate_signals()
Run the backtest:

python
Copy
bt.run_backtest()
Analyze the results:

python
Copy
bt.backtest_analysis()
Visualize the results:

python
Copy
bt.plot_equity_vs_asset()
Adding New Strategies
To add a new strategy:

Create a new Python file in the Strategies/ folder.

Define a class that implements the following methods:

load_data(path): Load data from a file.

populate_indicators(): Calculate technical indicators.

populate_signals(): Generate buy/sell signals.

run_backtest(): Simulate trading based on signals.

backtest_analysis(): Analyze backtest results.

plot_results(): Visualize results (optional).

Add your strategy to the repository and update the README.md with a brief description.

Data Format
The repository expects historical price data in CSV format with the following columns:

date: Timestamp in milliseconds.

open: Opening price.

high: Highest price during the time period.

low: Lowest price during the time period.

close: Closing price.

volume: Trading volume (optional).

Example:

Copy
date,open,high,low,close,volume
1633046400000,47000,47500,46500,47200,1000
1633132800000,47200,48000,47000,47800,1200
...
Dependencies
The repository relies on the following Python libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: Numerical computations.

matplotlib: Data visualization.

ta: Technical analysis library for calculating indicators.

Install them using:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib ta
